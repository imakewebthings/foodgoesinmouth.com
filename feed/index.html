			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/egg-tomato-top.jpg" alt="Egg &amp; Tomato" /><p>Last week, by way of <a href="http://brucel.tumblr.com/">Bruce Lawson&rsquo;s tumblr</a>, I learned of the <a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2011/03/26/the-lion-on-gripsholms-slott/">Lion of Gripsholm Castle</a>.  In short, it&rsquo;s a lion that was stuffed by a taxidermist who had never seen a lion.  He was only handed the skin.</p>
<p>This recipe is similar.  I&rsquo;ve eated Tomato Eggs a few times, since it&rsquo;s a common dish in China, but I&rsquo;d never looked at a recipe.  Starting with my vague idea of the ingredients involved, the recipe below is the result of 10 iterations, trying to make each less awful.  In the end it&rsquo;s damn good, but isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/tomato-eggs/" title="Tomato Eggs at Rasa Malaysia">the lion</a> I was trying to make.</p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Cherry Tomatoes, cut in half</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Pig foot gelatin (yea, I&#8217;ll explain below&hellip;)</li>
<li>White onion, as finely diced as you can manage</li>
<li>Green bell pepper, as finely diced as you can manage</li>
<li>Garlic, as finely chopped as you can manage</li>
<li>Green onion, the green part, 1.5 inch pieces</li>
<li>Cooking fat of your choice (olive oil, butter, and bacon grease are all good choices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, this pig foot gelatin thing, here&rsquo;s the deal. I cover a pig&rsquo;s foot in water in a pressure cooker and let it go for an hour.  I use the resulting softened foot in a dish, but that&rsquo;s another recipe.  The reserve liquid makes a great soup base, full of delicious gelatin.  If you keep it in a plastic container in the fridge it will solidify into something jiggly, a meaty Jello.  I know folks who eat this gelatin on its own in meals.  Personally, I just add it to sauces to give them more body.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the sack to render gelatin out of a pig&rsquo;s foot, go ahead and use chicken stock.  But know that everyone will think less of you.</p>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
<li>Heat some cooking fat in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and salt.  If you like high blood glucose levels add sugar, but caramelizing the vegetables adds a little natural sweetness.  Cook until the vegetables start to turn brown.</li>
<li>Add the cherry tomatoes, stir, and cook for a couple minutes.</li>
<li>Add the pig foot gelatin.  Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes. If things dry up in the process just add water.</li>
<li>Move the tomato mixture to a bowl.  Clean the nonstick pan out, add a healthy dose of fat, and heat over medium-high.</li>
<li>Beat the eggs with some salt in a bowl.  When the fat is quite hot add the eggs. I would explain how to properly cook the eggs, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRfLNGE2YUo#t=1m46s">this enthusiastic lady</a> demonstrates it perfectly.  Watch.</li>
<li>When the egg is cooked add the tomato sauce and green onion. Stir and let the flavors mix for about 30 seconds.  Serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I don&#8217;t like giving specific amounts in recipes I think this one could use guidelines.  For reference I used 3 eggs, 15 cherry tomatoes, a cup of gelatin, &frac14; cup bell pepper and onion each, and 4 cloves of garlic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/pork-carrot-top.jpg" alt="Carrot and Fat Pork" /><p>Every other dinner I cook includes this dish because it is so quick to cook, in large part because I keep boxes of prepped vegetables in the refrigerator for instantaneous use.  The cooking time is under 10 minutes in that case.  The prep is only another 10 or 15 from scratch.</p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Fat pork, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Carrot, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Green onion, chopped</li>
<li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>Garlic, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Light soy sauce, &frac14; cup</li>
<li>Chinese cooking wine, <a href="http://shop.waiyeehong.com/drinks/alcoholic-beverages/cooking-wine/chinese-cooking-wine-te-zhi-liao-jiu">Te Zhi Liao Jiu</a>, or a dry sherry if unavailable, &frac14; cup</li>
<li>Ground cumin</li>
<li>Ground dry red peppers</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/thumbs/pork-carrot-meat.jpg" alt="Raw fat pork" /></p>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
<li>First, when I say fat pork I mean whatever is pictured above.  The skin is still on one side, so remove that and cut the meat thinly against the grain.  I would love to help you out with the name of the cut, but the series of lines that title the package mean nothing to me yet.</li>
<li>In a bowl combine the meat, soy sauce, cooking wine, and green onion and mix.</li>
<li>Drop a healthy dose of olive oil in a wok over medium heat and add the carrot, garlic, cumin, and red pepper.  If you don&rsquo;t have ground up dry red pepper you can use a few whole ones, break them open and add.  Stir and cook until the carrots start to soften and lighten in color.</li>
<li>Crank the heat to high and add the meat mixture. Constantly stir and cook until the meat is cooked through and the sauce is reduced to coating the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Cut the heat, add the cilantro, and stir.  Serve.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/stomach-celery-top.jpg" alt="Pork Stomach and Chinese Celery" /><p>With 10 months between posts you might think I’ve given up on cooking food, that I’m resolved to drowning in buckets of KFC, frequenting <a href="http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&#038;q=ma+la+tang">ma la tang</a> street stalls, and sampling the hundreds of restaurants within walking distance.  But the truth is I’ve never cooked more in my life.</p>
<p>Problem is, I’ve been cooking completely normal dishes, at least relative to my location.  Or more accurately, the problem lies in the fact that I think normal dishes are a problem.  I’ve come to consider this site a place to explore new and original dishes, where recipes need to be refined over and over, ingredients explained and defended.  Where if nothing else, I end up waxing too damn poetic on whatever shit I’m cooking.  It’s mentally cumbersome and unfair.  These “normal” dishes deserve their time as well, and most of them may very well strike my American readers as <em>abnormal</em>, invalidating my own neurosis.</p>
<p>So it’s time for a small change.  I’ll be posting recipes. <strong>Quickly.</strong> As in with little explanation. Because the second I go down that road it turns into weeks of obsession, and more often than not, an abandonment due to lost hope or diminished excitement.</p>
<p>In the last year I’ve moved to a mostly <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101/">primal</a> diet, with a few concessions now and again.  Most dishes will fit this mold.  Most of them are whatever I cooked for lunch that day, with little forethought.</p>
<p>With that out of the way (I promise, short posts from here out), here’s the first dish.  Chances are you’ll never make it.</p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Pork stomach, sliced</li>
<li>Chinese celery, 2 inch slices (regular celery will work just fine)</li>
<li>Garlic, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Premium dark soy sauce</li>
<li>Pickled spicy red peppers, chopped</li>
<li>Ground black pepper</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Sesame oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
<li>Rinse the pork stomach and add it to a pressure cooker.  Cover with water and cook under pressure for an hour.</li>
<li>Pour out (or save, if you’re into it) the reserve liquid from cooking the stomach, but save a few tablespoons and transfer it along with the stomach to a bowl.  Add a half teaspoon of dark soy sauce (just for color), a healthy dose of black pepper, and a tablespoon of the pickled red pepper along with the brine, which should be easy if you’re getting the peppers from a jar like me.  Stir.</li>
<li>Heat a wok or pan to medium-high heat, add the olive oil, then add the celery and garlic.  Saut&eacute; for a couple minutes, or until the celery begins to soften.</li>
<li>Add the bowl containing the stomach and sauce to the wok. Continue to stir and cook for a minute to let all the flavors mix.</li>
<li>Right when you cut the heat, add two drops of sesame oil, stir, and serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tip on adding the sesame oil:  I’m willing to bet money that 9 times out of 10 when you use sesame oil you add too much.  It’s a flavor you want to add with subtlety but by volume it’s among the strongest oils.  A cruel combination.  Take it away from the dish, over the sink or garbage perhaps, and pour as little as you can on your stirring device, a wood spatula in my case.  Let the excess drop off leaving a thin coat of sesame oil on your stirrer, and continue.  If you’ve ever made a good dry martini, this will come naturally to you.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What makes a dish Chinese?  There are undeniable classics, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqi_feipian">Husband and Wife Lung Slices</a> (Fūqī Fèipiàn, 夫妻肺片).  You can find it in many restaurants, the dish has a distinct history, and the ingredients used are identifiably Chinese in combination.  So let&#8217;s look at today&#8217;s recipe.</p>
<p>You probably wont find it in a Chinese restaurant (no matter what country you&#8217;re in.)  This is home-cooked food.</p>
<p>The dish has a short history.  Compared to other dishes with roots in the Qing dynasty, it&#8217;s a baby.  Plus it&#8217;s fragmented. You&#8217;ll find a thousand different variations on the recipe if you search the web.  This one belongs to Zhao Jian, a Dongbei native and friend of the girlfriend.  I&#8217;ve taken out the ginger, added sichuan pepper, tweaked the amounts, and used smaller dice cuts.  Otherwise, it&#8217;s unchanged.</p>
<p>Most of the ingredients fit the mold, but the star didn&#8217;t make it to mainland China until the 1980&#8242;s.  Does that make the flavor American, transnational, fusion?  What would <em>you</em> call it?</p>
<p>I say it&#8217;s a perfect representation of modern China in one plate. Chinese tradition smothered in Western conglomerate influence.</p>

<li itemprop="ingredient" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/RecipeIngredient"><span itemprop="name">Coca-Cola</span>, <span itemprop="amount">16oz.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ul class="instructions" itemprop="instructions" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/RecipeInstruction">
<li itemprop="instruction">Lay out the package of chicken drumsticks.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Pick up each drumstick, take a knife, and put a couple scores (small cuts) into the meat of each drumstick.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Put the chicken right back down where it was.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Sprinkle salt, black pepper, sichuan pepper, and MSG on top of the drumsticks.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Pour the soy sauce on top of the chicken.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Give each piece a quick turn, just to mix everything up and cover the chicken.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Walk away for 10 minutes and enjoy a beer.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Heat a wok or pan, add the peanut oil, and get that up to the smoking point.  Leave it on high heat.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Add the chicken and marinade liquid.  If you haven&#8217;t already, turn on a fan.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Your oil will be pissed at you.  It will try to hurt you, but you have to keep moving the chicken around.  Maybe you have a pair of super long tongs, good for you.  Zhao Jian just does this with a normal pair of chopsticks.  Pain is gain folks.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Once the skin is a rich, tasty brown, add the garlic and green pepper and stir for 15 seconds.  Still on high heat.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Add Coca-Cola.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Bring it up to a simmer and turn the heat down just to keep the simmer going.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Put the lid on.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Wait.  The amount of liquid that will evaporate depends on your lid and the seal, so this part isn&#8217;t an exact science.  If after 30 minutes you still aren&#8217;t at the next step, remove the lid and reduce the liquid until you reach it.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">When most of the liquid is gone, remove the lid and put the heat on low.  The last bit of reduction is touchy and subjective, so don&#8217;t try to automate it. The sugar in the Coca-Cola will have caramelized and thickened it into a glaze.  A lot of people say these things are ready &#8220;when it coats the back of a spoon.&#8221;  If that works for you, fine.  I just stir it around and when it coats the chicken in a way that looks so appetizing I have to stop cooking it and eat it, I do.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Cut the heat, add the cilantro, and stir.</li>
<li itemprop="instruction">Plate.  It will still be hot so give it a couple minutes to cool.  This will also help the glaze stick to the chicken as more water is lost in the wait.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some problem with MSG, leave it out, fine.  Arguing with MSG haters is about as hilarious and useless as asking a flat-earther for directions.</p>
<p>In any case you should be left with sweet chicken just short of falling off the bone.  Make sure to keep a few napkins around.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/mangosteen-walnut-pops-top.jpg" alt="Mangosteen Walnut Pops" /><p>Returning from a three and a half month absence of food blogging because you’ve just relocated to Southeast Asia is, to be dead honest, painful.  There’s too much that needs to be said and you feel powerless to do an adequate job.  It will have to wait until I can process, break it down, and get my shit together.  But there’s one thing I’m ready to say about Shenzhen in this moment:</p>
<p>It’s fucking hot.</p>
<p>So when I noticed the latest <a href=”http://www.foodiefights.com/battle-10-frozen-dessert”>Foodie Fights</a> competition was “Frozen Dessert” I jumped at the opportunity to re-enter the ring.  Foodie Fights has undergone a metamorphosis since last season, and I’m excited to participate under the revised format.</p>
<p>So let’s get down to business.  It’s too hot to dick around with extraneous words.  First: <em>why I shouldn’t win this battle</em>.</p>
<h3>Points Against</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The recipe is too simple.</strong>  I know you looked at the picture and you’re saying, “Toothpick popsicles?  What are you, five?”  Sure, it’s three ingredients combined childishly.  I don’t care.</li>
<li><strong>The pictures suck.</strong>  They’re blurry, poorly lit, and lack color.  I don’t care.</li>
<li><strong>You can’t make this recipe.</strong>  Not that you don’t have the talent.  The recipe is cake.  All your problems come with that funny word in the title:  <a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Mangosteen”>Mangosteen</a>.  A detailed explanation to follow, but first&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Points For</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>These taste good.</strong>  Really good.  But, again, you’ll probably never know.  Here’s why.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mangosteens</h3>
<p>Three months ago if you asked me what a mangosteen was I’d have shrugged.  I’d heard the word but I couldn’t have pointed one out of a lineup, nor told you it was a fruit, let alone told you it was heaven in a thick purple rind.  Three days ago I still couldn’t have told you, despite having eating dozens of them.  That falls in line with my general food policy while in China.  I don’t care what it’s called or what it’s made of, just put it in front of me and I’ll make it disappear.  Only then did I ask the name, shanzhuyu, which led me down the Google rabbit hole.</p>
<p><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-1.jpg" alt="Whole Mangosteen" /></p>
<p>If you’re like me you know nothing about this fruit because we don’t have them in the states.  Well, not unless you’re willing to shop around at some specialty markets in New York, LA.  It only grows in tropical climates and until a few years ago the United States banned imports.  If you’ve had them fresh, I bet you had them on vacation.  You should be able to find cans of syrup and mangosteen in Asian markets.  I have no idea if they can compare to fresh (instinct and internet reports say no), but it’s your best bet for a replacement as far as this recipe goes.</p>
<p><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-2.jpg" alt="Open Mangosteen" /></p>
<p>When you work out the math, the local Walmart sells mangosteen for about $2/lb (13.8 RMB/jin to be exact) and you can find it on sale for as little as $1/lb.  If you read the Wikipedia page you’ll notice this fruit is mostly outer rind, so this only amplifies the expense.  The six mangosteens I used cost me 22RMB ($3.25).  Don’t let these numbers fool you.  This is expensive by Chinese standards.</p>
<p>For comparison, if you live in the U.S. and can even find this fruit fresh, be ready to drop $20-30/lb.  With the amount of sweet flesh you get, that puts mangosteen somewhere on the rich and famous shelf between black truffles and unicorn tenderloin.  These six ice cube popsicles might set you back $40.  Not counting the walnuts.</p>
<p>If you’re in a position where you’ve got fresh mangosteens, a pile of cash, and a penchant for turning gold into a kiddie snack, here’s what you do:</p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Mangosteen (Approximately one for each ice cube)</li>
<li>Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
<li>Walnuts, shelled</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ol class="instructions">
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-3.jpg" alt="Mangosteen flesh in blender" /></li>
<li>Remove the mangosteen flesh and place in a blender.  Blend.  If you didn’t notice the fibrous but soft seedlike thing in the middle that’s OK, because we’re just going to&hellip;</li>
<li>Strain.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-4.jpg" alt="Strained Mangosteen juice" /></li>
<li>Add one tablespoon sweetened condensed milk for every six mangosteens used.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-5.jpg" alt="Walnuts on a stick" /></li>
<li>Stab a piece of walnut through the end of a toothpick and place inside the ice trays.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/mangosteen-walnut-pops-6.jpg" alt="Mangosteen Walnut Pops, unfrozen" /></li>
<li>Add the mangosteen mix and freeze until solid.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sweetened condensed milk is added for two reasons.  It takes a little bit of the tart edge off the mangosteen.  Just enough to remove the punch on the tongue.  Also, sweetened condensed milk is tough to freeze, since it doesn’t contain any water.  I learned this the hard way in a number of mangled attempts at making the perfect Vietnamese iced coffee.  All this means is we get a slushier treat in the end, as we aren’t adding enough to completely stop the mixture from freezing in a standard freezer.</p>
<p>Now I gotta go.  It’s 2am here, I’m sweating, and I need one of these pops.  I’ll be back soon enough with a more realistic dish.  In the meantime, go vote for an ice cream or something.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/china-top.jpg" alt="Chinese flag" /><p>I don&#8217;t mean, &#8220;I love Chinese food; I should totally move to China.&#8221;  I mean, &#8220;In 7 hours I&#8217;ll be on a plane headed to Hong Kong.&#8221;  For reals, I&#8217;m moving to effin <strong>China</strong>.  If you want the whole background story and detailed scoop, check out <a href="http://100daysofless.com/mini-retirement/">the post I wrote</a> on my giving-shit-away blog.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t want to get into that again.  Read the post if you want details.  What I want to address here is&hellip;</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s going to happen to Food Goes In Mouth?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been way too damn absent from food blogging over the past few months, in large part so that I could focus on making the move.  Now that I don&#8217;t have a steady 9-5 I can come back to this thing I love, cooking.  That I will have to do it in a new country with a whole new setup in a wildly new phase of my life <em>will</em> keep me from flooding the web with recipes in the near future.  But I&#8217;ll return in force soon enough.</p>
<p>On top of just returning, I want to expand the scope of what I do here.  Holy crap if there aren&#8217;t <a href="http://www.gourmetfury.com/">plenty</a> of <a href="http://www.chezpim.com/blogs/">great</a> <a href="http://gourmeted.com/">sites</a> out there <a href="http://www.ellesnewenglandkitchen.com">full</a> of <a href="http://www.macheesmo.com/">inspiring</a> recipes.  I&#8217;d like to start aiming the occasional post not at you, the reading eater, but at you (possibly), the <strong>food blogger</strong>.</p>
<p>After attending the <a href="http://www.blogher.com/announcing-blogher-food-09-september-26-san-francisco-ca">first BlogHer Food conference</a> I couldn&#8217;t help but walk away with one overwhelming thought:  The conference could really use a Technical track.  Our community could really use some technical voice.  I think I can help.  From some real low-level beginner shit you can plug and play to some gritty in-the-mud hacking, I&#8217;d like to explore the occasional bit of code, plugin, blogging feature, <strong>all that nerdy stuff</strong>.</p>
<p>So when this all gets swinging again there will be the inevitable redesign.  This boring old crap I threw together in &#8217;08 has to go.  Maybe this would make a good series of posts for <strong>you</strong>, the food blogger?  The anatomy of a blog redesign?  What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/044-top.jpg" alt="" /><p>There&#8217;s good news and bad news.  The good news:  This is one of two things I&#8217;ve made that I would actually serve in a restaurant, were I the kind of guy who owned the kind of restaurant that brought you an amouse-bouche to kick off a meal.  Plus, the recipe is stupid easy. If I&#8217;m only going to post one recipe a month, I might as well make it count.</p>
<p>The bad news? That picture above is fake.  I took pictures of the real dish, then deleted them in the midst of <a href="http://100daysofless.com">purging</a>.  But the fake reconstruction above looks almost exactly the same.  And you can&#8217;t taste my pictures anyway, so <em>damn</em>.  On with the recipe.</p>
<p>This post is also my entry into Beet &#8216;n Squash YOU, a friendly monthly theme battle hosted by the lovelies <a href="http://www.gourmetfury.com/beet-n-squash-you/">Melody</a> and <a href="http://www.shesimmers.com/2009/10/beet-n-squash-you.html">Leela</a>.  After months of sitting on the sidelines I&#8217;m finally participating.  It&#8217;s Battle Mushroom!  Here goes.</p>
<p><a href="http://tiny.cc/kZk4w" target="top"><img src="http://www.gourmetfury.com/beetnsquash/bns_participant.png" border="0"></a></p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Kusshi Oysters</li>
<li>Shiro Miso Paste</li>
<li>Junmai Daiginjo Sake</li>
<li>Oyster Mushrooms</li>
<li>Chives, finely chopped</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ol class="instructions">
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-rbEXFwLw">Shuck oysters</a>.</li>
<li>Heat 1/2 cup of sake in a small saucepan until it reaches a boil.</li>
<li>Cut the heat and add 2 teaspoons of miso paste.  Stir vigorously until all the clumps are gone.</li>
<li>Place the miso sake sauce in the refrigerator until chilled.  You&#8217;ll have to restir the sauce when you take it out again.</li>
<li>Spoon a teaspoon of chilled miso sake sauce over the raw kusshi oyster.  Top with a pinch of chives, one raw oyster mushroom, and a pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Serve.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple; I feel bad calling it a recipe.  While it sounded good on paper, I was surprised just how well balanced all the flavors were once assembled.  </p>
<p>You can try swapping out almost all of the ingredient varieties until you find a combination you love.  Change mushrooms.  Try a different miso paste.  Shop around the sake section.  While Kusshis are a fantastic small variety of oyster, you might not have <a href="http://pier46seafood.com/">a supplier</a> in your area, and that&#8217;s fine.  Use what you&#8217;ve got.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/043-top.jpg" alt="Graham Cracker Apple Tart, Vanilla Caramel, Nutmeg Whipped Cream" /><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t bake.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll hear folks say those three little words for a wide range of reasons.  A few are turning their noses up, as if to say, &#8220;Bake?  That&#8217;s for women and peasants!&#8221; as though the grill and saut&eacute; pan are the only viable means of introducing heat to raw ingredients.  We&#8217;ll refer to this group as &#8220;Idiots.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hear many people explain their baking-free lives by saying, &#8220;I like the spontaneity of cooking that you don&#8217;t get with baking.  The exact measurements and weights and science behind baking aren&#8217;t for me.&#8221;  And boy do I understand the argument.  You sure can&#8217;t pop open the oven, grab the cake and a spoon, give it a taste, and firmly chuck a handful of garlic at it before returning it to the hotbox.  Which is why I have spouted this argument myself in the past.</p>
<p>What irks me about that idea is how it comes across, at times, as equally condescending as the &#8220;Idiot&#8217;s&#8221; argument.  Sometimes what I hear is, &#8220;Baking is just exact measurements.  If you have the recipe, mix the ingredients accordingly and go, it&#8217;s done. <strong>What&#8217;s so hard about that that?</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, the improvisation so adored by non-bakers is just one thing that makes standard cooking so hard and baking difficult.  I can overcook my pasta sauce by two minutes.  I can add one too few cloves of garlic and twice as much basil and everything is more than just fine.  It&#8217;s arguably original.  The mistake here is assuming that because the instructions are written, plain as day on a piece of paper, they are as good as executed in the kitchen.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t make that leap.  And you can&#8217;t claim that&#8217;s it&#8217;s easy enough to do, if you simply chose to do it.  Until you physically do something, you haven&#8217;t done it.  Until you get exact, follow instructions to the letter, and stop leaning on the flexible cane of whimsical cooking, you will not bake.  And if you have not baked, you cannot bake.  You don&#8217;t hear folks claim they can swallow swords without ever having gulped down so much as a toothpick.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the strict science behind baking doesn&#8217;t kill original recipe creation, it makes such originality admirably more difficult.  You need to understand levening, proteins and fats, glutens, tempering, and so much more.  Beats the hell out of something as mindless as switching orange for pineapple, or adding paprika.  A baker is a true craftsman and good original recipes are admirable.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong>, with all that laid out, I&#8217;d like to say, &#8220;<strong>I don&#8217;t bake.</strong>  The patience and dedication required to so much as reproduce a recipe in this field escapes me, the lazy cook.  I don&#8217;t bake, not because I find it trite, but because I come to it with the knowledge of a child.  In short, I don&#8217;t bake because it scares me shitless.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time I took baby steps.</p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Graham Crackers, pulverized into tiny bits</li>
<li>Butter, melted</li>
<li>Granny Smith Apple</li>
<li>Ground Saigon Cinnamon</li>
<li>Brown Sugar</li>
<li>White Sugar</li>
<li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
<li>Fresh Vanilla Bean</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Ground Nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
<li>Follow the <a href="http://southernfood.about.com/cs/pierecipes/ht/graham_crust.htm">about.com</a> instructions for a basic graham cracker pie crust.  That is, combine 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 6 tbsp of butter in a bowl with your hands.</li>
<li>Press the crust evenly into a 10 inch pyrex dish.  Yea, you should probably use a pie tin.  But I made this at my folks&#8217; place, and they don&#8217;t have one.  Not that I have one at my own apartment&hellip;</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/crust-thumb.jpg" alt="Graham Cracker Crust" /></li>
<li>Core and peel the apple. Using a mandolin slicer, make thin even lengthwise cuts.</li>
<li>Arrange the apples on top of the crust.  You could and should overlap the apple pieces in a circle and make it look pretty.  I didn&#8217;t, because I wasn&#8217;t thinking.  And I knew I&#8217;d just be covering it up with all the remaining steps.</li>
<li>Dust a couple pinches of cinnamon over the apples.  I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t have an exact measurement for this part, but I&#8217;d guess I used 1/2 teaspoon in total.  Just evenly and thinly coat.</li>
<li>Evenly distribute 1/4 cup brown sugar over the apples.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/sugar-thumb.jpg" alt="Tart Pre-Oven" /></li>
<li>Move this to a 375&deg; oven for 15 minutes.  I did it for 20 and the edges got a little too crispy and brown.</li>
<li>Make <a href="http://savorysweetlife.com/2009/11/simple-yet-glorious-caramel-sauce-recipe/">Alice&#8217;s caramel sauce</a> per her instructions.  <strong>Except</strong>, warm the cream in a small saucepan.  Take half a vanilla bean, split it open and scrape out the inside.  Add the bean and scrapings into the cream and whisk vigorously while the cream warms.  Remove the bean pod before incorporating with the syrup.  Tada, vanilla caramel.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/caramel-thumb.jpg" alt="Vanilla Caramel Sauce" /></li>
<li>Chill a metal bowl, the inserts on your electric hand mixer, and a cup of cream.  You can whisk by hand too, should you be looking for a bit of a workout.</li>
<li>Add 1 tbsp of ground nutmeg to the cream and begin beating on low while moving the mixer around.  When the cream starts to thicken, you can pick up the speed.  Stop when the cream reaches <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080711124441AAaaYy8">soft peaks</a>.  Increasing the mixer speed early just makes for a mess, by the way.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/drizzle-thumb.jpg" alt="Drizzling Caramel" /></li>
<li>Cut the apple tart into service size wedges, top with caramel, and a dollop of whipped cream. Declare victory over dessert.</li>
<li class="imgstep"><img src="/thumbs/043-top.jpg" alt="The final product" /></li>
</ul>
<p>This was also my first dessert.  I think the only reason I don&#8217;t make desserts is that I almost never eat them.  I rarely order it at restaurants, almost never buy them at the store.  I just don&#8217;t think about it.  The people who ate my tart enjoyed it, so this might inspire me to give dessert a try more often.  A certain member of the family ate the remainder of the caramel with a spoon, so once again bravo to Alice for giving us such an easy to follow recipe.</p>
<p>Ok, I know, graham cracker crust dessert, it&#8217;s barely if at all baking.  But I got my toes wet.  Next time I&#8217;ll get down to my ankles in the shallow end.  I&#8217;m thinking p&acirc;te &agrave; choux?  Maybe for some goug&egrave;res? <strong>If you have any suggestions for relatively easy next steps, go ahead and leave a comment.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/thumbs/042-top.jpg" alt="" /><p>Today is this little site&#8217;s 1 year blogiversary.  Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m supposed to look back at the past year of posts and say, &#8220;Yay, I made it!&#8221;  Nah, this post is looking straight ahead.  More on that later.  Let&#8217;s get down to the food first.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was holed up in Cupertino, once again, without a kitchen.  But I was lookin&#8217; to cook and was given access to JC&#8217;s kitchen.  Thanks JC!</p>
<p>She took all of these pictures, except for the one below (by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/patriciayee/">Patricia</a>), and several others that can be found in her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jypsyq/sets/72157622672650890/">Noms Party</a> set.</p>
<p><img src="http://s86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/042-ribs.jpg" alt="Sogalbi" /></p>
<h3>What I Used</h3>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Korean cross-cut beef short ribs</li>
<li>Green onions, chopped</li>
<li>Soy sauce</li>
<li>Sesame Oil</li>
<li>Rice wine</li>
<li>Umeshu</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Did</h3>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl or ziploc bag and let marinate for 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the ribs from the marinade and move to a charcoal grill for 5 minutes on each side.  I didn&#8217;t have a grill so I used the broiler.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeshu">Umeshu</a> is an alcoholic beverage containing unripe ume, also known as Chinese Plum.  I do recommend drinking this in a cocktail and not shots because it is diabetic-coma-inducingly sweet.  This is why I left the usual sugar out of the Galbi marinade.  The alcohol content of the umeshu also accounts for the short marinating time, since I didn&#8217;t want it to denature too much of the protein and render the ribs mush.</p>
<p>There were a couple of little side dishes in tow.  They aren&#8217;t much on originality, so no post of their own. :P</p>
<p><img src="http://s86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/042-gobo.jpg" alt="Kinpira Gobo" /></p>
<h3>Almost Kinpira Gobo</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_burdock">Gobo</a> is a root vegetable notably tougher than carrots.  It may be most commonly seen in a traditional Japanese appetizer called kinpira gobo.  What I made contains about 60% of the ingredients and only half of the correct techniques as the traditional recipe, but this was my first time and I was operating off of flawed recollection.  Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>
<p>Take julienned gobo and saut&eacute; for 15 minutes in sesame oil and sugar.  Add an equal part julienned carrots, a little bit of soy sauce, and saut&eacute; for another five minutes.  If things get too dry, just drizzle a little more sesame oil in the pan.</p>
<p><img src="http://s86.photobucket.com/albums/k95/thedthawk/042-bokchoy.jpg" alt="Garlic Baby Bok Choy" /></p>
<h3>Garlic Baby Bok Choy</h3>
<p>Separate and wash the bok choy leaves.  Heat corn oil in a wok until it starts to smoke.  Add salt and minced garlic and then immediately, before the garlic burns, add the bok choy and kill the heat. While the wok is cooling and cooking the bok choy, toss/stir it in the garlic and oil furiously.  You&#8217;re done when things stop sizzling.</p>
<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>Just two days ago I launched a website for a little &#8220;project,&#8221; <a href="http://100daysofless.com">100 Days of Less</a>.  I&#8217;m dumping the vast majority of the stuff I own over the course of 100 days.  This means blogging at least once a day more than three straight months.  In that time I&#8217;ll have tripled the number of posts made here in the last year.</p>
<p>I imagine this will take a significant amount of my blogging focus.  Or who knows, maybe it will just get me into a writing mood regularly and I&#8217;ll blog here more than ever.  I do know that when it&#8217;s over there will be a massive rethinking of the direction and focus of Food Goes In Mouth.  Until then, it&#8217;s business as usual.</p>
